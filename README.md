# Online SQL Editor Made for Atlan-Assignment

A SQL-EDITOR frontend application made for the Assignment given by Atlan. 

## Technologies used :-

Following technologies were used for the completion of this project:

    1. ReactJs
    2. Bootstrap

## Packages I used :-

    1. csv
    2. react-code-blocks:
    3. xlsx

## Overview :-

    A frontend SQL-Editor web App where a user can run queries and according to that dataset will be displayed. 
    
    As in this project only frontend is used so I have some static queries by default which a user can use to use it. Besides clicking and selecting a query a user can also write the same query in the console given in the app and can get the same output.
    
     Not only this this app comes with a ADD YOUR OWN DATASET section where a user can define his own table and can export it to use in the app ,isn't this interesting!. A sample dataset(DATASET of CUSTOMERS) is there in the app for user reference in case he has to match the data.

     For a quick start I have provided a example text which user has to click and it will get copied and he can paste it in the console(QUERY Editor) provided in right side of app (for mobile devices it is below the example) to start.

     As I said it is static so i have 6 query button options provided to the right side of QUERY ARENA.
